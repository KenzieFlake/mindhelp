    <p>McKenzie is a college dropout who jumped from job to job, hoping to find her place in this cruel
        and desolate
        place called, "The World." Although she's faced many great hardships she's always done her best to keep going,
        and throughout all of it she remains positive (mostly). Who can say where she'll go? Who knows what knowledge
        she'll acquire that'll be totally important once she passes through the veil (it probably won't be)? It's about
        time she started this new journey in life, and about time she stopped procrastinating, complaining, mumbling,
        whining, crying, and just being a wittle baby! You've got this McKenzie, just don't mess up!!</p>
